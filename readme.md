# Semen (alpha-1)

A Nano Service Framework for NodeJS. Inspired by Grunt and Gulp, **Semen** was made to create a services runner. 

While Grunt and Gulp usually used
for build process, Semen is supposed to run both build process and serving process. So, basically we can use the same runner for everything.
